Option,Priority addressed,Systems where suitable,Species for which suitable,Description and implementation constraints
Diversify species,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","Raising multiple animal species within the same farming system. This strategy aims to achieve a variety of benefits, such as risk mitigation, economic stability, resource optimization, and lower environmental impact. Instead of focusing exclusively on one species, farmers diversify by incorporating different types of livestock. Species diversification is typically constrained by labor, and knowledge."
Switch between species,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","Switching from one species to another within the same farming system. This can increase resilience (e.g., switching from cattle to more drought-tolerant species such as goats, sheep and camels), reduce farm emissions (e.g., moving from ruminant species to pigs or poultry), and speed up household cash turn-over (e.g., move from large animals to small animals that can be purchased or sold easily in response to a cash squeeze), for example. This option may be constrained by labor, knowledge, and cost."
Improved forages and feeding,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed",Cattle,"Implementation of advanced practices to enhance the quality and efficiency of the forages and supplements provided to animals and improve their nutrition. This approach aims to improve animal health, productivity, and overall farm sustainability. This option is typically constrained by availability of forages and supplements (especially during the dry season), labor, knowledge, and cost."
Improved grazing management,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland",Cattle,"Management of pasture and grazing lands to optimize the utilization of forages and promote sustainable and efficient livestock production. This approach involves various techniques and principles aimed at maximizing the benefits of grazing for both the livestock and the land. Improved grazing includes rotational grazing, grazing planning, rest periods, species selection, water management, fencing and infrastructure, and monitoring of animal movements in the farm. Land tenure, labor, and knowledge can be important constraints to scaling of improved grazing, as is cost."
Restocking and destocking,Adaptation,Rangeland,Cattle,"Adjusting herd size to adapt to seasonal changes in feed supply. Build up herd sizes in recovery periods to prevent total loss of herd during drought. During drought, culling of weaker animals for food and cash needs. Constraints include market accessibility, price fluctuations, socio-cultural considerations. Herd recovery in more arid environments can take many years."
Manure management,Adaptation and Mitigation,Intensive confined systems,"Cattle, Pigs,  Poultry","Systematic handling, treatment, and utilization of animal manure in agricultural and livestock operations. It involves implementing practices to effectively manage and capitalize on the nutrient-rich organic material produced by animals. Whereas labor is the main constraint for manure management, cost and knowledge can also be important bottlenecks. In Eastern Africa, for example, manure disposal is a complex problem as animals produce more manure than can be recycled in the surrounding agricultural areas."
Water management,Adaptation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","Increasing access of livestock to water and improving the efficiency with which it is used. Examples include rain water harvesting in ponds and digging a well to exploit ground water. Constraints include cost, land tenure, labor and maintenance of ponds or wells."
New breeds ,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","Selectively bred varieties of animals within the livestock industry. These breeds are often created with specific goals in mind, such as improved productivity, adaptability to certain environments, disease resistance, or the enhancement of desirable traits for agricultural purposes. Accessibility, cost, and knowledge often preclude widespread adoption of new breeds for livestock farmers with limited financial resources.

This option can also include the use of ""unimproved"" breeds that have desirable traits, such as trypanotolerance in cattle. In Africa there is considerable unexploited genetic variation in indigenous breeds that could be utilised by farmers, though limited information accessibility and cost are major constraints."
Rangeland restoration,Adaptation and Mitigation,Rangeland,Cattle,"Rehabilitate and improve the ecological health and productivity of natural rangeland ecosystems. Strategies for rangeland restoration include vegetation management, grazing management, water management, soil conservation, invasive species control, wildlife habitat restoration, and community engagement. Bottlenecks for scaling rangeland restoration include cost and knowledge.

Silvopastoral systems,Adaptation and Mitigation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland","Cattle, Sheep, Goats","Integrate trees, forages, and livestock in a mutually beneficial manner within a single land management unit. These systems are designed to optimize the ecological, economic, and social functions of both forestry and livestock components. Silvopastoral systems could increase productivity, decrease GHG emissions, improve carbon storage potential and aid adaptation to heat stress. The scalability of silvopastoral systems has been limited by several factors including knowledge, cost, and land tenure.

Income diversification,Adaptation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","In rangelands and the mixed systems, involvement in market-based schemes for water, carbon, biodiversity and tourism, to diversify income sources (payment for ecosystem services, PES). Constraints include the challenges of monitoring, land tenure, knowledge."

Weather and climate information,Adaptation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems","Cattle, Poultry, Pigs, Sheep, Goats","Data, forecasts, and actionable advisory based on short-term weather patterns and longer-term seasonal climate outlooks. This information is crucial for livestock farmers to anticipate and manage feed and water during drought and heat stress events, disease management and access to veterinary advice, water resource management for grazing areas, market planning, and emergency preparedness. Access and knowledge to use weather information are the most critical bottlenecks for scaling. CGIAR's work on climate services is extensive, covering over 15 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, using methodologies such as the Multidisciplinary Working Groups (https://hdl.handle.net/10568/113733 ), Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (https://hdl.handle.net/10568/134781 ), the Shamba Shape Up (https://hdl.handle.net/10568/126423 ), amongst other digital and participatory channels."
Weather index-based insurance,Adaptation,"Mixed irrigated, Mixed rainfed, Rangeland, Intensive confined systems",Cattle,"Risk management tool that uses specific weather-related indices as triggers to compensate livestock producers for losses incurred due to adverse weather conditions. Unlike traditional insurance, which requires individual assessment of losses, index-based insurance simplifies the claims process by linking payouts to predefined weather parameters. Automated payouts reduce transaction cost and enhance transparency. Index-based insurance is mainly constrained by cost and knowledge especially related to financial literacy and record keeping.
